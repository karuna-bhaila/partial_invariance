# Chi square difference testing for Partial Invariance

All code required to run the tests is in `chi_square_difference_testing.ipynb` file.

## Requirements
  numpy==1.21.5
  pandas==1.4.2

## Test Data
Place your file containing chi-square values in the `data` folder.

## Run


## Results
The results will be stored in two files: `results_<*input filename*>` and `summary_<*input filename*>` in the `results` folder.
The `results_<*input filename*>` file contains individual search results for each scenario and the `summary_<*input filename*>` contains the sum of the results from all scenarios.
